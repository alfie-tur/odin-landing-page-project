# odin-landing-page-project

This project, from The Odin Project website, is to create a landing page based on designs they have provided using only HTML and CSS

Finished for the most part, I may go back to this project later down the line to optimise it's CSS so that it all fits much nicer. Not everything may have been done in the optimal way however I am still learning.

Does not fit on all devices and may not look as intended on different sized monitors as i haven't learnt how to do that yet.
